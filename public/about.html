<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Samrawit Hailu Tadesse, and I reside in Addis
  Ababa, Ethiopia. Currently, I work as a lecturer in the Department of Architecture at the Federal
  TVET Institute (FTVTI). I hold both a BSc degree in Civil Engineering and Architectural Design
  Technology from a recognized university, which has equipped me with a solid foundation in technical
  knowledge and problem-solving skills. Additionally, I recently completed my Master's degree in
  Environmental Architecture from Adama Science and Technology University (ASTU).</p>

<p>Over the years, my passion for web development has grown steadily, and I am determined to pursue
  this field as I believe it offers endless possibilities for creativity, problem-solving, and innovation. I
  am fascinated by the way web development combines technology, design, and user experience to
  create interactive and visually appealing websites.</p>

<p>In the next ten years, I envision myself as a highly skilled fullstack webpage developer contributing to
  innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology in architectural design and sustainable
  development. With this scholarship, I will have the means to achieve my goals and make a meaningful
  impact on society by creating user-friendly and environmentally conscious web applications.
